# 💻 Error Handling Flow
This flow detects the error that occured in the `Try` scope block and displays out the error message (either in email or sent thru chat).
## ⭐ What I've Accomplished
- Detects error
- Displays or send error message and it's reason why it occured
- Flow can be used as a template
