# 💻 Automated Flow - Update When DocuSign Has Been Sent
This automated flow will trigger once a document from the DocuSign website has been sent or delivered to the signee. It will then update the value in the **SharePoint List** to show the status of the envelope.
## ⭐ What I've Accomplished
- Detect if the document from DocuSign has been sent
- Retrieve related data in SharePoint based on DocuSign's sent envelope id
- Update column in SharePoint list
