# 💻 Approval Flow with Multiple Responder and Filtered Email
This automated flow includes approval flow wherein all assigned members are required to respond `Approve/Reject` to the notification that will be sent to **Microsoft Teams**. Approval flow will only occur if the assigned email address (**Outlook**) has received an email with a title containing "Contract" in the subject, and if there is an attached PDF file.

> 🔴 **Note**: You can change the part of the starting trigger (*when a new email arrives*) to trigger the approval flow, it can be also like when there is a modified list from **SharePoint**!
